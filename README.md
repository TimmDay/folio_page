# folio_page

A working version of my portfolio to show in job interviews.

To Do
- clean up the code directory structure
- get a github integration workflow sorted out. Time to learn

MAIN PAGE

- mobile first...

- tech recruiter buzzwords section
- blog section up
- apply performance enhancements to the site
  - resize all pictures
  - compress all pictures
  - minimize code
- compress the page. maybe have a separate html page for ABOUT
- does having pictures displayed on different html pages still effect the performance of the current page?

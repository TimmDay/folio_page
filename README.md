# folio_page

A working version of my portfolio to show in job interviews.

To Do
- clean up the code directory structure
- get a github integration workflow sorted out. Time to learn

MAIN PAGE

- move experience/education stuff to the header
- instead of contact menu item, get a email icon and put it with social
- mobile first...
- portrait smaller
- resume section into header
- header title line up with base
- exp/edu tables appear under header
- ditch footer entirely, have the little footer title at base of folio
- make all social icons 128*128

- tech recruiter buzzwords section
- blog section up
- apply performance enhancements to the site
  - resize all pictures
  - compress all pictures
  - minimize code
- compress the page. maybe have a separate html page for ABOUT
- do I need that background image...? I suspect yes, but I can make it lower quality.
- does having pictures displayed on different html pages still effect the performance of the current page?
